## Part 1 ##
Implement a k nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier that can best recognize the
10 different classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Details:


 * Download the dataset from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
 * Nested bullet
 * Train your best k-NN using the 50000 training set.
 * Using 5-crossfold validation technique, find the best “k” for this dataset. Answer also the following:
   * Is L1 distance better than L2 in this problem?
   * Is grayscale image space better than the original color space? 
   * Use the 10000 testing set to report the accuracy of your classifier.
   
## Part 2 ##

Implement a linear least square classifier (LLS) that can best recognize the
10 different classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
