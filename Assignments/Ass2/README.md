# Practical_Machine_Deep_Learning

Implement a multi-layer fully connected Neural Network (NN) classifier that
best recognizes the 10 different classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Details:


 * Download the dataset from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
 * Implement YOUR OWN NN such that you can dynamically change the architecture, e.g., number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, etc... 
 * Implement YOUR OWN gradient descent learning algorithm (preferably using the computation graph method)d) Use a validation set (or n-crossfold) to fine tune your hyper- parameters. 
 * Use the 10000 testing set to report the accuracy of your classifier .
